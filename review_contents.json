As far as arch support In my opinion it is great. High arch support. Now I Wear a true 7.5/8 M. I bought an 8. I am wearing a thin low cut no show sock. These fit true to size with perfect room in the toe box. I stated above I'm an average or ( M) width. These are perfect for me especially post surgery on my left foot.  However, it is my opinion if you have a narrow foot These probably are not the best shoe for you. If my feet were no a bit swollen they'd be to wide for me and by no means am I narrow. I'm also going to swap insoles. There will be room for orthotic insoles. These are extremely comfortable they are sharp looking and they are light weight.
