But Not Centaur Proof.", "content": "Before you read this review I can save you a lot of time.  Buy these.  However if you want more info than that you can read on, but keep in mind this is not an in depth review on how these buds are technically.  I could get into frequency range before and after break in with pink noise and all kinds of other crazy crap, but I'm not going to bore you with that.  You might be able to find that type of review in one of the other 1900 five star reviews.  I'm just going to give you, what I hear, aside from the voices.  But seriously, you can save yourself a lot of time by just buying them.  C'MON THEY'RE ONLY $6.  Okay, waste your time if you want.  Read on if you must.  But you'll probably be disappointed. I normally don't write reviews because English is not my first language... bad English is, but on these I just had too.  Let me start out by saying before these I had an awesome pair of Bose In Ear Headphones, the old ones.  They cost about $100.  I did not pay for them.  Someone else who is dumb did, and then further proved their lack of intelligence by giving them to me.  Actually, they were a, very generous, Christmas gift I got a few years back from the company I work for.  Those ear buds were awesome, but like everything else I love, they died.  I did manage to get several years of good use out of them, and I treated them like a red headed step child.  The fact they lasted as long as they did only goes to show that Bose makes quality stuff.  Well, now that I think about it, for $100 maybe they should have been impervious to damage by human means, or possibly even mythical means.  I'm going to say it, they should have been Centaur proof. So after what I refer to as the \"Great Loss of 2010.\"  I then went on a search for a decent pair of replacement buds, in the $20 range; because as is proof by how I treated the Bose ear buds, I shouldn't be allowed to have nice things. I tried many different types of replacement buds from different manufacturers.  I'm not going to list them all because I don't have that kind of time.  I will say through all my testing that 50% were just okay, and the other 50%... well I would rather have listened to the final death rattle of a puppy.  A really cute and sweet looking puppy.  You know, the ones you see on the TV that make you feel guilty for not donating to the ASPCA. Well, after losing yet another pair of the okay ones, how I had those Bose for so long I have no idea, I needed a replacement and decided to try a different brand.  I went again to the internet and performed the search, \"good cheap headphones for someone who should not have good things.\"  I hit enter, the search results came up, and clicked on a link that appeared to be a tech review site and let me tell you... they are really good at disguising porn sites to look like normal sites in search results these days.  So after seeing something that I will never be able to unsee, I came across the Panasonic RPHJE120S and figured for $6 on Amazon I'll give them a shot.  I've wasted $6 on far worse. They arrived the day before I ordered them, as Amazon has awesome shipping, especially if you are a Prime Member.  I grabbed my Zune, no I don't have an IPOD because I believe Apple, and the late Bea Arthur, are trying to kill me.  I put in the buds and selected a track to play, expecting either okay sound or sound so bad that I would black out and wake up naked in a quarry with a dead rodent in my mouth.  The latter has only ever happened to me twice in my life... three times tops... four at the most... possibly every Friday.  Once my selected track started playing I was just amazed, to find my neighbor on his roof trying to fix his satellite dish in a t-shirt, pair of boxers, rubber rain boots, and a tool belt, with no tools in it, unless you count him.  The sound out of the ear buds was awesome too!  Clear highs, nice bass, just great frigging sound.  It sounded like the puppy was right in the room with me.  Then I turned on some music and was further impressed.  Initially the highs in certain songs seemed a bit, too high, but over time the buds broke in to be just pure awesome.  A $6 dollar pair of headphones that competed with those $100 Bose buds I had.  Don't get me wrong, Bose is Bose, but to even approach sound quality on par with those Bose buds in a $6 pair of Panasonic's is damned amazing.  But be warned, these buds ARE NOT Centaur proof.  I checked.  They are fairy resistant though. I have also found them pretty comfortable, and they stay in my ears pretty well.  I have fallen asleep with these things in.  I did an experiment in which I tried to give myself night terrors using audio.  It worked, I have never felt the same since.  I may have also released something that can only be described as pure evil into the world.  But like I said they were real comfortable and stayed in my ears even when I woke up screaming and thrashing about. Maybe if you are insane, or a complete audiophile, or both, because they usually go hand in hand, you can pick apart these headphones.  I have friends who are audiophiles/insane/schizophrenic and they can find issues with even the best audio gear.  If you are looking for a good set of buds to use in everyday use that have great sound you really can't beat these.  My first pair of these I had for about year, and then I lost them.  I actually think I know where I left them but promised I would never go back... DAMN YOU NEBRASKA!  I just bought 2 more pairs and just got done making sure the they worked and thought to myself; \"I have to review these, they deserve it.  Also, I need to teach Amazon a lesson for giving me an outlet to share my opinions.\"  I believe this is the first product I have ever reviewed on Amazon and if you have read this far you can probably see why.  I'm an idiot. If you need ear buds... get these.  If you don't need ear buds get them. Hell, if you don't like them you are only out $6.  With almost two-thousand 5 star reviews, including this one, it's a pretty good sign that these are in fact good buds.  If you don't buy these it's a pretty good sign that you are in fact an idiot.  I would know, we can spot our own. Yes, I have read the bad reviews, that's what I do.  I research a product to death and then look only at the bad reviews to see if the complaints really seem valid or sane. This may sometimes scare me away from perfectly good products like the Nokia N-Gage, HD-DVD, and reusable toilet paper.  But sometimes, especially with bigger purchases, I really want to feel sure after ordering the product, that I have made a huge disastrous mistake.  However, that being said, I have no idea what happened to some of the people that left bad reviews for these.  Maybe they got defective buds, or they are really picky audiophiles, but having heard them myself I can't agree with those reviews.  I also don't agree with the law of gravity or that 9/10 of the law involves possession. I have also beat the hell out of my first pair of these buds.  I used them for everything, airplane, car rides, while I was cleaning around the house, and in the gym.  Occasionally I have used these as a leash for my dog, and in two instances these saved my life from demons, that live in my head.  Apparently head demons hate death metal, but absolutely love smooth jazz.  Strange, I know.  Seriously though, in the gym these things got ripped out of my ears a whole lot of times and they still kept working.  Like I said, in the end I lost the first pair, but they still worked great when I lost them. I'll finish on a serious note and stop joking around for just a bit by saying this, at the end of the day everyone's hearing and preferences are different.  You can hate something that I love and vice versa.  That's just how it is.  So in the end there is no guarantee, but if you do the math and you even count the 3 star reviews as bad, only 19% of everyone that bought these did not like them.  The other 81% like me... nothing but love baby.  These things sound great, fit in my ear comfortably, they stay in my ear pretty good, even when I am at the gym, and seem pretty durable. See, I told you could have saved a whole lot time if you would have just bought them, but you needed to keep reading.", "date": "31 Jan 2013", "images": null, "author": "J.

Of course, any failure to differentiate the \"cheap\" from the ultra-high end brand would immediately be blamed on numerous variables, which are likely to affect a listener's judgments about an \"earbud\"-sized phone more than is the case with full-sized headphones.  With IEM phones there are always questions about the size and materials of the ear-tips, and the particular \"seal\" that is achieved while listening.  Moreover, the judgment is always necessarily highly \"subjective\" and relative to listeners' personal tastes.  If it's not a blindfold test, the preference may come down to listeners' susceptibility to makers' promotional material, the added \"designer-quality\" features (including packaging), and lots of elitist hype supported by technological jargon based on physics and acoustic principles. Oddly, listeners tend to disregard the source material and its limitations, regardless of the technology of the transducers (i.e. phones or speakers) used to reproduce the frequencies of the source material.  Yet, more often than not, the source material is compressed to the size of an mp3 file with a bit rate of 128 kbps as compared to a non-compressed WAV or AIFF file of 1411 kbps.  So unlike the high fidelity systems of the 1970s--AR3 vs. KLH \"sealed\" speakers vs. McIntosh and JBL combinations of woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters in a single gigantic cabinet--all designed to transmit the \"non-compressed\" signal embedded in the grooves of a long-playing record--the \"stakes\" in today's audio comparison/shoot-outs are far lower and less significant.  Instead of \"which system can reproduce the full frequency spectrum?\", the question has been reduced, merely, to which system sounds best while translating the limited information of an MP3 file into sound that is most pleasing to the perception of the listener? With practice and with certain types of music that has been recorded by certain engineers, I'm now able to distinguish between Apple Lossless compression (files of 768 kbps) and common MP3 files (128 Kbps), but the perceived difference is neither habit-forming nor behavior- changing.  I'm still inclined to go with whatever \"sounds best\" to my ears.  Invariably, I'm impressed by the phones or speakers that, to my sensibilities, best represent the \"sounds in nature,\" ie., the actual, pure and non-distorted, non-altered sounds of instruments recorded individually and in ensemble contexts as well as the complete range of the male and female human singing voice.  But when listening to an engineer like Rudy Van Gelder, who distorts the sound of the piano and enhances the sound of horns to offer the listener clearest access to all of the instruments being recorded, the headphones or speakers can do little to rectify the imbalances found in the source material.  It's when listening to the engineers who recorded \"Kind of Blue\" at Columbia Records or to the recordings of Roy Dunann for Contemporary Records that my ears perceive the truest, most \"natural,\" deepest and most complex sound of an instrument, or instruments, or the human voice--IN SPACE.  Without regard to \"context\" (or what some listeners refer to as \"ambiance\") there is no longer a standard of reference, or a \"sound in nature,\" which necessarily will have 3-dimensional realism, or depth.  Instead, the sound is manufactured and altered long before being picked up by various amplifying speakers in earphones, headphones, or elaborate speaker systems. In the case of these Panasonic phones (costing $5) and the Sony phones (costing $10--though there are times when the prices are reversed, depending upon matters such as color and supply-demand), the consumer can be prepared to hear full-fidelity music, with clear reproduction of textures and pitches, from the double bass through the piano (and its overtones) through a percussion kit (including bass drum, snares, crash and ride cymbals, and the hi-hat's \"chic chic\" sound on the off-beats), to the human voice itself (in this instance, Roberta Gambarini's). I compared the two phones with each other as well as with phones in the $50-$100 area (Sony MDR-EX300LP, Altec Titanium Backbeat UHP326) and phones in the $200 area (Sony MDR-EX700LP).  I suspect that the latter phones not only \"wear longer\" (due to better construction, thicker cords, etc.) but \"wear better\" (I can listen to music for several hours without any sense of discomfort or mounting pressure in the ear).  But as far as initial impressions go, the sonic differences are too small (and subjective) to be worthy of mention. The Sony phones are very slightly smaller and more lightweight, which may account for my sense that the music I was hearing from the Panasonics had fuller textures and more body, especially in the mid-range.  To put it differently: with the Sony phones I was hearing music played with stunning, pristine clarity while standing at the BACK of the music room;  with the Pansonic phones, I was down front, practically a hostage to the crack of the drummer's sticks, the pedaled overtones of the piano, the bassist's articulation of the strings (not merely the bass's tones).  Very likely, the same effect could be achieved with the Sony phones by using smaller ear tips (for a tighter seal) and turning up the gain (the Panasonic earphones are a trifle more \"efficient\"--i.e. sensitive--than the Sony phones, which require turning up the volume to reproduce the same resonating textures.  The Panasonics use a special, \"ergonomic\" angle along with an \"angular\" tip that ensures deeper insertion of the tip into the ear canal, thus accounting for some of the added \"body\" I was hearing in the sounds of the instruments and vocals.  Some listeners many prefer the more conventional ear tips of the Sony phones.  (Both phones provide two additional sets of tips, which are, in both cases, constructed with a stiff center, along the lines of Sony's acclaimed \"hybrid silicone ear-tips\"). I'd recommend ordering these Panasonic phones for $5-6.  If you like them, order another set before they wear out and the price goes up.  If you don't, order the Sony phones and keep the Panasonics on hand for the inevitable day that they fail (providing you don't accidentally step on them first). [Ignore the aficionados' advice to \"burn in\" the phones, even before wearing them.  Even with high-end, costly phones, that's merely reducing the average lifetime of the phones for listening.  Moreover, either of these ultra low-priced Panasonic or Sony phones is ready to go into action from the moment you extract a pair from the box.  (Feel free to ignore the crumpled up instructions and warranty.)]", "date": "26 Nov 2012", "images": null, "author": "Samuel", "rating": "5.0", "found_helpful": "8 people found this helpful", "variant": "Color: Red Style: No Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar"}, {"title": "Very Comfy and Durable!!", "content": "UPDATE July 2 2017: At some point, I ended up using these as my primary headphones. After adjusting to them, they are actually very comfortable. The first several times I wore them (see my original review, below) they weren't that comfortable but I evidently didn't give them enough of a chance. 1. They are very comfortable to wear even over long periods of time. I use them as my headphones for all day at work and they don't bother my ears. 2. They stay in just fine working, walking, etc. I haven't tried them while jogging but I've yet to have much issue with them falling out or coming too loose. 3. The sound is great for the price. It's not \"Bose\" or anything obviously, but the sound is much better than my Coby earbuds and roughly equivalent to my SoundBot. In short, it's balanced and clear without sounding super bass-y nor tinny. 4. I've just learned today that they are very durable! I was looking all over for them and couldn't find them so I just used some other headphones and what do you know - I had tucked them in a shirt pocket and accidentally washed (and dried) them! I thought for sure they were done for. The cable even felt a little bit softer, but nope! I plugged them into my laptop and started up a video and they still worked. They didn't sound any different than before I washed(!) them. They were very tangled but I can live with that. Overall, I would highly recommend these headphones now after giving them more of a chance myself. And, if you're like I was initially, try giving your ears a little more time to adjust. ORIGINAL REVIEW (November 2015): I read several reviews before buying these and got intrigued. My ears are small or shaped weird - especially my left one. I don't know what it is but I have never found ear buds comfortable. The original kind that have a Hershey Kiss speaker shape that goes in your ear - those are the worst. The soft in-ear kind are significantly better, but still not comfortable to me and they have a tendency to fall out. I prefer regular over the ear headphones but those aren't so acceptable at work. I bought a pair of SoundBot headphones that were super comfy, but after awhile the left side broke. It still works, but jiggling the wire pauses songs, skips songs, and even turns the volume up or down (which there isn't actually a control on the headphones for). Wanting to find a replacement (and not be locked in to one specific brand of style), I tried these. For starters, they are cute. I mean, for ear buds. The blue is a pretty blue, it is a bit brighter than say, royal/Superman blue. Also, they do actually stay in my ears pretty well. The ear piece sort of hooks into the shape of your ear in a similar manner as the SoundBot ones, locking it in place. It isn't stuck in there however, and still relies a bit on the shove-it-in-your-ear factor. The cord is decently long, a comfortable length in my opinion. However, it is thin. I feel like it could easily have a similar problem within a few months if I don't take extra good care of them. That said, there is no control for anything on these headphones so hopefully if it started getting damaged, it would have no effect. The sound is very good, especially for the price. I have a pair of cheap, Coby ear buds and the sound quality on those is noticeably lower than any others I have tried - so these are better than that, at least. These I would say are a notch below my SoundBot headphones and a few notches above the Coby. I would say my SoundBot headphones are about on par with my original Galaxy S5 headphones for sound quality,  if that helps. One thing I dislike is that I can easily hear background noise through these headphones. It isn't crystal clear, but in a noisy office, I find myself having to turn the volume up further. It isn't to say that they are SUPPOSED to have noise-cancel, but I got used to it with my Galaxy S5 headphones and especially with my SoundBot ones. Galaxy S5 headphones block out the majority of background noise, and the SoundBot ones block out all but the loudest. Even without anything playing, they have a noise-cancel effect. OK, now for my primary complaint. All other factors the same, I would be very satisfied with these headphones if they were only more comfortable. It's strange, too, because on the right ear it's perfect. On the left ear, painful. I have avoided using my Galaxy S5 headphones because they aren't so comfortable to me, but I actually practically retired these ones in favor of those. I don't know what it is about my left ear. I tried switching the medium/default tip for the smallest and I might say that's even less comfortable? I can't quite put my finger on it. The speaker hole is narrower - it's an oval, not a circle, giving almost an appearance like the latest iPhone headphones. I thought that would have been perfect, and it is on my right ear. My right ear could probably wear it all day, but my left ear can't stand it. So, I know I have talked most this review about my broken SoundBot headphones, but that's only because they are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever found. For me, comfort takes precedence over pretty much all other features (save for price) because I just can't stand wearing most ear buds. That said, here is the fib ranking: Sound Quality: 1st/2nd: Galaxy S5 and SoundBot (tie) 3rd: These Panasonic headphones 4th: Coby Comfort: 1st: SoundBot 2nd: Galaxy S5 3rd: These Panasonic headphones 4th: Coby Appearance: 1st: These Panasonic headphones 2nd: Galaxy S5 3rd: Coby 4th: SoundBot Price: 1st: These Panasonic headphones 2nd: SoundBot (by a few dollars) (I can't rank the Galaxy S5 because they can with my phone and the Coby came as part of a set with other headphones) Features/Functionality: 1st: Galaxy S5 (play/pause/skip/phone and volume) 2nd: SoundBot (play/pause/skip/phone) 3rd/4th: These Panasonic headphones and Coby (tie - no controls) Overall, if my left ear wasn't so sensitive I would probably love these. Because it is so sensitive, I find them almost unusable. Otherwise, for the price and general quality, I would recommend them for less finicky ears.", "date": "26 Nov 2015", "images": null, "author": "Heather", "rating": "5.0", "found_helpful": "6 people found this helpful", "variant": "Color: Blue Style: No Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar"}, {"title": "Excellent Bass Response", "content": "I use these for when I go walking, and while I love over the ear headphones, it's just not practical for that activity.

These Panasonics are not designed to be placed in the ears and worn like classic earbuds.  If that's how you wear them, you'll get nothing but tinny sound at relatively low volume (think 1960's pocket transistor radio.) These earbuds are specifically designed to fit snugly into the ear, forming an airtight seal.  If you choose too small of an earpad and/or don't push them in far enough, you won't hear any low-end frequencies. It's only when you get an airtight seal that the earbuds will instantly come alive with full-range sound and volume. Here's a quick analogy: Tightly plug both ears with your fingers, close your mouth, and hum the lowest note you can.  Now take your fingers away, and notice how almost all of the low end and volume drops out.  That's the difference between a proper fit and an improper fit with these earbuds.  Although the acoustic principles are different, these earbuds must literally plug your ears in order to give you the full frequency spectrum.  Otherwise they'll sound horrendous. Unfortunately, Panasonic wasn't very forthcoming on their product's packaging about how to wear the earbuds, and I'm certain some unwitting consumers are throwing away perfectly good pairs. As an audio engineer, I can assure you these earbuds, when properly fitted, sound excellent for the price.  They're not audiophile-quality earbuds with the sonic transparency of a $200 pair of studio-reference headphones, and they're not as ergonomic as a $150 pair of Westones, but for the price, they are an exceptionally fantastic bargain.  Do they have a lot of bass?  They're not deficient in any of the low frequencies, but they're not bass-enhanced earbuds, either, which some of you may be used to.  They have a relatively nice, flat bass response as is, but if you want extra bottom end on your music, you'll want to boost the low end of your MP3 player's EQ.  Fortunately, boosted lows, even the deepest of lows, are handled very well by these Panasonics. As a result of how these earbuds are designed to be worn, they could be uncomfortable for some people to wear for extended periods of time.  The earpads are very soft and pliable, though, and I personally don't experience any discomfort wearing them.  Since these earbuds are designed to be wedged into your ear, there are two unique, negative issues to point out: 1. Be very careful not to drop your MP3 player, because having earbuds ripped out of your ear canal is not a pleasant experience. 2. These earbuds may amplify the sound of your heartbeat when it's racing during an intense workout.  The incessant \"tick tick tick\" is loud enough that it becomes extremely annoying during quiet passages in the music you're listening to. In summary, the audio quality of these earbuds, when properly fitted, will satisfy 99.9% of the general population.  I would not recommend them for bike riding or street running since they block out ambient noise, and if you're an audio engineer, you may find them a touch brittle on the high end, but if you need some quality earbuds to tune out the world for a while, these Panasonics are an excellent choice and a phenomenal value.", "date": "24 Apr 2012", "images": null, "author": "EasyTiger", "rating": "5.0", "found_helpful": "4,278 people found this helpful", "variant": "Color: Orange Style: No Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar"}, {"title": "Sometimes you just need the basics!", "content": "When it comes to headphones it seems like I've tried the all.

I have been on this quest for years as I am always never without my mp3 player or radio.  I am rough on headphones and go through them fairly regularly.  So I am always trying to find inexpensive headphones that sound better than my previous set (Skullcandy Ink'd).  This time, after carefully reading reviews, I purchased 3 different headphones at once, all in the same price range (Under $15.00): The Panasonic RP-HJE120-A (Blue), The Skullcandy Jib, and The 2XL Spoke (Bounty Hunter Collection). My conclusions were that the 2XL Spoke were adequate, but a distant third place. While the 2XL had definitively better bass than the Skullcandy Ink'd, the 2XL's mids and highs were only adequate.  The Skullcandy Jib completely blew the Scullcandy Ink'd away, with much better bass, mids and highs, I thought I found what I had been looking for, that my quest had ended.  But there was still the Panasonic RP-HJE120 to listen to.  I must say I had little expectation for these after listening to the Skullcandy Jib's.  But what was this?  Immediately the Panasonic's sounded impressive.  After listening to them for a while, I listened to the Jib's again.  I honestly preferred the cleaner sound of the Panasonic RP-HJE120, and the Ergo design was a plus, the fit was just so comfortable.

I had been using a pair of JVC HAFX66 which I absolutely loved as well as my Apple earbuds which were only used for phone calls.  So the search began looking for a set of earbuds that hopefully could solve my previous use of two different sets of earbuds to handle music while working out as well as being able to use it for phone calls.  I am cheap when it comes to earbuds since I tend to lose or destroy them on a somewhat regular basis, so I try to spend under $30.  I have a similar rule for sunglasses for the same reason. To note, my preference is for bass heavy sound.  I listen to just about anything from rap, country, rock, classical, and anything else in between.  It doesn't matter, I like bass. I was able to compare directly side-by-side the older M6P, M6, M7P, and the RP-TCM125. **MEE M6P I have had these since 2010, but had never used the MIC on them.  I just used them at work and at the gym for music for many years.  These were very bass heavy which I liked, but not quite as bright in the mids and highs.  For the price, these could not be beat at the time.  I am pretty sure I paid under $15 for these. +comfortable +decent sound quality +bass heavy +stayed put in my ears +included carrying case -tips came off easier than I would have liked (I have newer M6 that seem to not have this issue) -cable failure in one pair (many years of use and abuse) -MIC voice quality (far end stated I sounded muffled) -MIC issues on iPhone6 (lots of popping, clicking...remember this is a 6 year old set) **JVC HAFX66 I had owned the JVC HAFX66 since around 2011 and had gone through 2-3 pairs due to either losing them or getting them run through the washer/dryer accidentally.  It appears they are no longer available as well as I would like something with a MIC on it. +very comfortable (used them for background music on a 12hr flight) +sound quality was more balanced the the M6P (strong bass, but mids/highs were smoother) -no MIC **JVC HAETR40 Extreme Sports Pivot Motion Fit These were my first replacements to try since I could pick them up at a local store.  In the end, I ended up returning them mostly due to the lack of bass.  If these had been cheaper, I probably would have kept them as backup since they were quite functional and comfortable. +fit good +very clear sound quality +MIC worked, no complaints from the far end about my voice quality +short cord +included cord extension -short cord (was almost too short, but then too long with the extension) -lack of bass....serious lack of bass The lack of bass is what ultimately doomed these for me.  The bass was lacking so much, it was like they weren't seated properly within my ear...yet they were.  I really wanted to like these. **Panasonic RP-TCM125 These were ordered based upon reviews I found for best bang for your buck.  These were just to be music earbuds since they don't have a MIC.  I have not used these yet while exercising so unknown how well they will stay put.  For sure, these are the most balanced sounding out of all of the earbuds I have so far.  These overall seem to me to have the best all around sound. +comfortable fit +sound quality is wonderful (voices are warmer, bass is still strong) -cable seems to be pretty cheap, weak (reminds me of the cheapo dollar store ones) **MEE M7P I was still looking for a proper earbud with MIC that can do it all.  The price was right and my history with MEE was good so why not. +fit good +good sound quality (bass not as strong as M6) +stay in place while running +comes with carrying case +MIC worked, no complaints from far end about my voice quality (while sitting still) -MIC was popping or dropping out when I was up and moving around (I have a support ticket open on this) **MEE M6 I went ahead and also purchased a set of M6 since I pretty knew I would like these. +fit good +stay in place no matter the activity +sound quality decent (strong bass, but mids and highs aren't as powerful) +comes with carrying case -no MIC So all of this....which pair do I use the most?  The M7P will end up in my laptop bag for sure for travel purposes...but more than likely I will end up using the M6 the most since I know it stays put while running.", "date": "27 Sep 2016", "images": null, "author": "Michael C", "rating": "5.0", "found_helpful": "One person found this helpful", "variant": "Color: Black Style: With Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ergofit-Headphones-Metallic-RP-HJE120-RA/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}, {"title": "Back to Basics", "content": "Was wireless for years and used to use these in HS.

Now I'm looking for a good replacement.", "content": "The janitor recently stole the pair of Skullcandies I usually left at work.  I wanted a good music listening pair to replace them.  I recently bought several \"cheapish\" ear buds, one 20 dollar set, and a set of JVC flat headphones recently.  I couldn't decide based on reviews alone, so tried several different options.  I know it was silly.  I should have just spent it all on one \"nice\" pair, but I thought it would be fun, and it actually was.  Besides, why give the Janitor such a big target.  ;p  I also discovered different roles for the buds I bought.  They nearly all have a place in my collection.  :]  Win win. I'm no audiophile, or sound professional.  Evenso, I bet I'm like a lot of you.  I want nice sounding music to accompany my day while quieting the environment.  I hope these comparisons will be helpful so you don't have to buy a bundle of buds, and can maybe zero in on a set or two that will serve your tastes best.  I enjoyed comparing and contrasting, and actually noting quit a bit of difference. The buds/phones I tried are iLuv iEP322ORG [orange] in-ear Ultra Bass ~6 dollars Panasonic RPHJE120K [black] in-ear ~6 dollars Yamaha EPH-20Bu [supposedly blue but actually purple] in- ear ~20 dollars JVC 10HAFC earphones ~3 dollars JVC \"Flats\" on ear headphones black ~12 Skullycandy \"Ink'd\" in ear buds ~15 [already owned, but in for comparison] Sentry Wind-Ups in-ear buds ~5 dollars iLuv: I chose the orange iLuv's because it was the cheapest color on Amazon.  I enjoyed their sound overall.  They are the most bass heavy of the group.  However, they leave the highs and mids a little neglected.  They also reduce ambient sound decently, so you can focus on what you are listening to.  So while these are not the most balanced, your teen will probably love the sound.  They are also on the \"loud\" side.  Even at minimum device volume these came in the loudest.  As such, I will probably put these in with one of my DS systems' carrying cases.  It will be great for those, and be on hand so I won't have to scrounge around for a pair, when I want to hear the game and not my wife's TV programs.  These also won't be my work or walking pair, because they don't look very adult [again, your teen will probably love them], and they produce the second most \"cord noise\" in the group from the cords rubbing on your shoulders or clothes while you are walking or exercising.  If I had nothing else to compare to, I think I'd have been very happy with this set. Panasonic: The Panasonics were probably the quietest of the group.  Sound is relatively balanced, with no real extremes.  Bass seems light for an in ear bud.  They are now my go to bed buds.  I can put my device on minimum volume and easily go to sleep.  The iLuvs and Skullcandy were too loud to be comfortable on both my phone media player and iPad mini's lowest setting for sleeping.  The Panasonics are also small enough, that they weren't uncomfortable for side sleeping.  These also produced the least cord noise from movement, so should be good to walk, exercise in.  Noise reduction was decent and reduced my wife's snoring several decibels.  This might not be so great for outdoor exercise, where you may want to hear your environment for safety.  I may even get a second set or carry mine back and forth so I can walk at lunch break in these, since I have a protected area to walk [no cars, etc.].  The lack of cord noise really makes the difference here. Yamaha: I was curious about what I would get by going a little upmarket.  Granted it's not much of a jump at \"only\" 20 dollars.  The Yamahas were probably most similar in sound to the Panasonics or JVC flats.  They had a good all around balance and were more full than the Panasonics.  Bass is not prominent, nor is it missing.  They sound best with Classical music in my experience.  On the down side, they were advertised as \"blue\", but Yamaha's idea of blue is very clearly Purple.  It's not a major issue, but be aware, if you choose this color.  Cord noise seemed on the loud side, compared to the JVC buds and Panasonics.  I probably would not want to do anything active in them.  However, if I could \"only\" have one bud, this might be it. JVC HAF10C earbuds: For only around 3 dollars you shouldn't normally expect too much.  Agree?  Well, I already had a blue pair [ 4 dollars at retail] so knew what to expect.  It's a testament I bought another.  This pair was black, and I far prefer the gorgeous blue plastic set, but would not pay a couple extra dollars on Amazon for that choice.  I know it shouldn't matter, but I REALLY like blues.  Anyhow, the most unique feature of this set is the clamshell case you get.  It allows you to wind your cord and protect the buds.  I wish higher quality buds would do this.  I'd pay a couple extra bucks for it.  The case does not work well for most in-ear buds, I would guess.  I am able to get the above Yamahas in one case [why I ordered an extra set], but it is not a perfect fit.  Larger buds probably won't fit.  The buds themsevles have a durable hard plastic casing and should be quite durable.  Sound is actually nice, for non-in ear buds.  For the price I doubt you'd find better sound.  They are also on the quiet side, and not being directly in ear, you could probably give these to your kids without the threat of hearing damage you might get from louder and in ear buds.  I use these to walk, talk radio, and some music.  Unlike most in-ear, I can wear comfortably all day if I loosely cradle them on ear.  While outdoors, they allow you to hear the environment, including wind, which is a downside.  Fortunately, they do not generate the cord noise that is such a pet peeve of mine.  Great all around value.  I don't know that the value can be beat for the quality of plugs, and the very well designed case.  Being so cheap, I also don't have to fret too much if the Janitor decides to steal this pair also. JVC \"Flats\": These are on ear headphones, so probably not fair to compare to ear buds.  Still they were part of my purchase, so I am including for contrast.  At only 12 dollars, I was very surprised how crisp and clean these sounded.  They delivered a balanced spectrum, without sacrificing bass as I'd expected.  They do not isolate noise as well as in-ear, but you do get some reduction without having to turn your music WAY up.  For straight music listening or watching a video, I might choose these most of the time at home.  They do not seem to generate cord noise due to movement, but are bulkier than what I want to walk in.  They also fold \"flat\" making them a nice travel pair for people who don't like in-ear buds.  I keep mine in an inexpensive ipad mini neoprene case, for example.  Would be easy to take on a plane.  I have a big head [really], despite their diminuitive size, they adjusted to fit very comfortably.  I can wear for long sessions, without bother.  Can't go wrong with these. Skullcandy \"Ink'd\": This may not be a fair comparison either.  I think these had the greatest \"retail\" price when they were new, but I bought them on sale at Ross stores for about 15 dollars.  These are a few years old, so might be an older make than what is available now.  However, I am still surprised by how good these sound to me.  Of all the ear buds in my collection these are probably my favorite for music.  It figures, after buying several, the one I had still sounded best to me.  It has plenty of bass, without sacrificing the overall quality like the iLuvs seem to.  However, it is still one of the loudest of my collection, and is uncomfortable to sleep with on my devices.  My radio is more sensitive and can tune more quietly, but I rarely use that to sleep to.  This set also probably produces the most cord noise of any ear buds meaning they won't walk the beat with me.  It also features metallic red and white buds, white cord, and the companies trade mark as a red skull.  While I think they look \"cool\" the skull and colors all look a little childish.  They are not as garish as the iLuvs, but they are certainly second in my comparison.  That said, there are more sedate colorings available, however they all have the contrasting skull logo in some fashion or other.  As such these will mostly be used privately. Sentry Wind-ups: These were my least favorite.  I was drawn in by the promise of a nifty carry case again.  I might have kept just for that, if they'd have worked.  However, the cord winder was rather difficult to accuate, at least for my biggish hands.  Also my pair of buds may have been defective.  The right bud produced only half the volume of the left.  I took back to Wal-mart asap.  At only 5 dollars, I didn't expect much, but I did expect balance across left and right.  I would presume that was a single item issue, but I did not want to get a second pair to find out.  Sound was more hollow than most I tried, not even measuring up to the 3 dollar JVC's. There it is.

They do not have an inline button thing. They seem to be pretty good quality construction. The sound quality is also pretty good, not mind blowing, but very good. They seem to be a excellent value for their price. I got them because they are Panasonic brand & under $8. I got the kind without an inline button, because I hate inline buttons. I'm glad that Panasonic is still making earbuds without inline buttons. I hope that these will live up to the quality I expect from Panasonic & last a long time. One thing I noticed about the \"ergo\" design is that the speaker part on the earpieces are oval shaped instead of circular. I've never had any other \"ergo\" earbuds, so I don't know if that's unique or not. It doesn't seem to make a much difference in fit, but it can make changing the silicon pad parts slightly trickier than on a round one. The rest of the \"ergo\" design doesn't seem to be a big deal either. They don't seem to fit any better or worse than regular \"non ergo\" earbuds, but with the \"ergo\" design the ends don't stick out as much. They do seem to stay in place in the ear better than \"non ergo\" ones tho. They cost less than most regular \"non ergo\" earbuds, so I have no complaints about the ergo design. The last pair of earbuds I had were \"fake brand\" earbuds from a local store that cost $15 (\"on sale\") & stopped working after about a month. I don't beat up my earbuds, I just use them on my PC, I don't tie the wires in knots or pull on the plugs or stomp on the earpieces or anything like that. Yet it seemed like every time I got new earbuds they would cost more & break faster. I am sick of earbuds that have an inline button thing. I never use the button things. I don't even know why they are there, they don't seem to do anything. Yet it seems like every pair of earbuds simply must have them now. Some claim to have a microphone built in. I have no use for that, I use these to listen to my PC, not talk on my phone & my phone has its own mic anyway, why would I need one on an earbud? Some claim to have volume controls. I have never gotten any of these so called volume controls so do anything useful, I press the button, it does nothing; even if they worked I have better volume controls on my PC. My only experiences with inline buttons are negative. The last few pair of earbuds I had owned all stopped working because the tenuously soldered wires in the button parts broke. And the wires are too thin & the PCB is too tiny & fragile to try repairing. (I did intend to re-solder the broken wire, but two others - there were four in total- broke off just from me handling the PCB, the wires all looked the same & with no way to tell which wire went to which corner, I gave it up. It was not worth the hassle of dealing with a tiny part, seemingly designed to break at the slightest provocation) My conclusion is that the button things are built in as deliberate weak points of failure.

ORIGINAL REVIEW Needs User Manual I'm using this version with a Chromebook computer. I've found the listening sound excellent, better than any of my other headphones. The earbuds are the right shape, are very comfortable, and do not fall out. That having been said, I have a suggestion for Panasonic: Make and include a user manual! The fact that there is no user manual makes it odd that the box has this stated warning: \"Before connecting, operating, or adjusting this product, please read the instructions completely.\" The only insert paper is a small sheet with product specs, warranty info, and a blanket warning about hearing and volume of listening. I searched all over the Internet for User Guide, Manual, or Instruction sheet, but no more than the above was found. I think we can safely conclude there is no user manual and no instructions to read for this product and you are on your own. That was a setback when I went to test the mic online. According to the testing sites, the mic did not function. I was prepared to send it back, when I thought to try pressing the button on the mic. Well lo and behold, after pressing the button \"to answer calls\", the mic did show up on testing. A second press made the pickup even stronger, as evidenced by playback of the test. The second time, I could even let the mic dangle instead of holding it up. This is just a guess, but this mic button appears to have multiple functions, thus the need for a manual. Reading through some of the currently 200+ reviews that mention \"mic button\", people frequently mention using the button to skip songs. The product description says the button is to answer calls. But what all is the mic button supposed to do when using these buds with a computer!? Could the issue some reviewers are saying with the mic not working, or not pick up the voice well, be resolved with an instruction sheet?

Given that I'd had no interest in investing in audiophile-grade equipment at the requisite audiophile-grade prices, my main concern was finding something somewhere within that delicate balance of \"Quality-enough\" at just \"Cheap-enough,\" and it seemed to me at the time that these just MIGHT have fit that bill: they did have the \"Panasonic\" name going for them, after all. But even I, who actually WAS trying to \"cheap-out,\" was impressed with the crispness and clarity, as well as the unexpected comfort, of these buds. Again, they are not anything to go for if you're looking for Top-of-the-Line type quality or heavy-duty performance... but if all you're looking for is something simple and basic, and yet packs a surprising amount of audio quality, I can easily imagine less stellar choices.

Definitely a \"recommend\" for someone who does not require much but who still appreciates those little pleasant unanticipated surprises that occasionally accompany such decisions. _____ [\"update\" addendum]: After a series of hours'-long phone conversations using the \"microphone\" variety of these ear buds, I was so impressed with the results that I'm literally right now, as of the typing of these very words, in the process of ordering a SECOND \"mic-equipped\" set \u2013 one to be set aside strictly for \"in-house\" phone calls, and the other as a \"travel set\" in case of ever needing to make/receive phone calls outside of the house or while on the road.

These are awesome for the money. There seems to be a tendency to pile on with \"me too\" reviews, so I wasn't sure what I'd think of these things - but at the price I thought I couldn't lose.  As a frequent traveller I also thought they'd be a good option for air travel where I might forget them on an airplane (where, if I am not using a personal device, doesn't have great audio quality anyway). I compared these to an expensive set of Grado headphones, a mid grade ~$100 pair of Klipsch earbuds, and my desktop monitor system (which is a standalone uDAC2, \"Fat Man\" integrated amp with tube preamp, and KEF iQ1 speakers).  I used the DAC's headphone output for the earbuds, used the Fat Man headphone output for my power hungry Grados, and obviously used the Fat Man speaker level output for my KEF bookshelf speakers. My point isn't to needlessly compare the above items (as I doubt many would cross shop them), but simply to illustrate that I directly compared several sources to form my opinion of the Panasonics. - The Panasonics have \"big\" bass (at least in my ear canal).  I'd like the bass to be toned down slightly, but I'd rather have the current bass level than a shrill tinny product if I were forced to pick extremes.  The bass bloom might actually be preferable under some circumstances (loud jet, cutting grass - which I do with ear protection over my earbuds, working out, etc). - The ability of these to passively block ambient noise is average and acceptable. - They have a warmish midtone that is probably pleasing depending on the device these are coupled with. I do wonder if my setup had a bit more power available than these were designed for.  Sometimes a good clean audio setup leads one to crank the volume higher than they otherwise would do. I may have just been \"cleanly\" overloading these drivers (which might not be practical with some portable devices and is never a good idea regardless of what upstream equipment you have).  At lower levels (and therefore any level that I'm likely to listen to for more than 2 minutes they sounded very good). - Although I think the warmish midtone is a decent feature of this product in some cases, if you find a track where there's a hint of gritty midrange warmth/distortion you can really hear things lose some definition.  I'll give 2 example cases: (1) Taking U2's \"The First Time\" (a somewhat obscure track I admit), there's an outro sequence where keyboards get progressively louder and overload most driver/amp combos that I've heard the song played on (maybe because the generally low level of the song inclines one to listen to the first 80% of it louder on the dial).  It wasn't until I got a fairly high end rig that I noticed the keyboard \"clipping\" I was used to wasn't part of the recording (or was 3% of the magnitude that I had previously thought). (2) Listen to the last minute of Johnny Cash's \"Hurt\" cover.  It's an amazing song, but the general grittiness of how the vocals are presented during this bit combines with the characteristics of these Panasonics to show how the warm characteristic isn't always a good thing.  Other factors (such as the rasp of Cash's voice here) probably come into play, but it's a case where you can appreciate the characteristic of the Panasonics when comparing them to other products. - High frequencies are perfectly pleasant.  They may lack a little bit in absolute detail but I'm happy to listen to them and don't have much other criticism to offer.  If I can't get a \"perfect\" (neutral) earbud I'll take a less fatiguing presentation of high frequencies any day. - This is a personal criterion, but these are probably the most comfortable earbuds I've ever worn.  I have smaller ears and an average ear canal size, but I couldn't imagine a better fit for my personal needs.  I mentioned being an avid traveller, so the comfort of these will probably matter more to me than relatively minor audio distinction between these and $50+ earbuds when I'm on my next 10hr flight. These aren't an end-all to earbud listening (but you'd be foolish for having made that assumption despite the overwhelmingly positive review tally).  However, at this price just buy them and try for yourself.  If they don't suit your needs give them to someone you know (as they come with extra ear buds you'll be able to find someone to use them). If I were forced (as an audio enthusiast) to spend the rest of my life doing all headphone/earbud listening on only these earbuds I'd probably be \"mildly annoyed\" (and largely because I know what else is out there).

These are my first pair of in-ear earbuds and as many have already said, they are to be worn sealed into the ear canal to get the proper fidelity. You cannot simply fit them into the opening of the ear and get any bass response at all. I knew this but didn't know how you were supposed to get them inserted properly and I struggled in the absence of any pertinent guidance. I understand that everyone's ears are shaped a little differently but what I found that worked for me was to insert the bud into the opening of my ear canal and rotate it while applying inward pressure (kind of like turning a screw) until the cable/shaft points upwards (see my pic). When the bud is situated this way it slides into my ear canal and makes the appropriate seal and I can run the cable behind my ear. No amount of inward pressure could get the proper seal with the cables hanging downward like you would think it is intended.  It took me a while to figure this out. I also discovered that there is a fine line between pushing it in just enough to create the seal and pushing it in too far. Go too far and they begin to hurt rather quickly... and they hurt pretty bad. So find the spot where they seal but go no further. Again, it took me a while to figure this out. When positioned correctly I can wear them for extended periods. That being said, once fitted correctly - sealed in the ear canal - these buds provide an adequate (quite a bit actually) amount of bass and sound isolation compared to the regular headphones that simply rest in front of the ear opening. The bass was too much at first. I realized I had my EQ settings on my device set to a high bass boost to compensate for my old headphones. Once adjusted to flatten out the bass they sounded fantastic. I've never had any other high-end earbuds to compare these to but I feel that these sound great especially for the price. They do a very good job of keeping out surrounding noise. I used them on a recent flight and they did a MUCH better job keeping out the background noise of the jet than my old phones. Use caution when walking/running as they can block the sound of traffic and other hazards you would otherwise hear. Summary: These Panasonic in-ear earbuds are a great value and have exceptional sound... once you learn how to properly use them.

I have always used the earbuds that came with my phone until they broke. The earbud that I have to compare this one to is the AKG tuned earbuds from Samsung that came with my Samsung Galaxy S8 long time ago. Well, after a couple months of use, the left side of the Samsung earbud stopped working, but I continued using the other side until the rubber around the earbud started tearing and became a mess. I have still been using it until today, when I received these Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds. I purchased these because it's the most affordable earbuds from a reputable brand that I could find (with almost 100k 4.5 star review average!) since phone companies stopped including earbuds with their phones to garner more profit from separate sales and expose us to even more radiation with the wireless earbuds for the sake of continuously advancing new luxury technology, fashion, and convenience. ANYWAY... Let me tell you straight away that the first thing I did when I received this product is check the back for any Chinese or foreign language text (after reading another review here about receiving a counterfeit product with pictures to prove) and did not see any of that. Also mine happens to be made in Vietnam rather than China if that means anything. I was not impressed at first sight. The earbuds are TINY compared to the Samsung earbuds I've been used to. The wire is also super THIN and fragile, I'd say, and needs to be taken care of to make sure they don't snap or break. I tried putting the earbuds on and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortably they fit. They definitely feel like they go in my ear farther than the Samsung earbuds did. I plugged it up and started listening to them and understood why so many people posted great reviews about them. I am not an audiophile(? audio expert), but I know I loved the sound from the Samsung earbuds and was hoping for something similar- and they definitely deliver in my opinion. The bass is a little more pronounced in these earbuds than the Samsung ones (maybe because they go inside your ear more? idk) and overall sound quality is satisfactory. The only reason for knocking off 1 star is due to the fragility of this product. The AKG tuned Samsung earbuds had thicker/sturdier wires and braided cable to make it even more quality/durable. A shame that it didn't last as long as I had hoped for, but now I will enjoy these ones and hope that they will last a long time. P.S.

I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality was definitely adequate. Durability was generally good, although both inside mesh covers got destroyed almost immediately and needed to be removed. They lasted me through many nights of studying and a couple of degrees, until I pre-emptively bought a replacement pair along with a couple more as gifts in mid-2020. Ultimately the first pair lasted about three years before one side began to fail - I could still hear music out of it, but the volume was greatly diminished. I think three years is a pretty good lifetime for what was a $8.37 purchase, and I opened my second pair with equally high hopes. The second pair was a lot more disappointing. Like the first, the inside mesh covers failed very quickly. Also like the first, one side started to fail with low volume. But unlike the first, that side began to fail after  only about a years' worth of usage. Not to be deterred, I contacted Panasonic as instructed by their Amazon page. They told me (in what seemed to be an automated email) that this product was not repaired but would be replaced entirely if it fit the warranty criteria. I would pay the cost of shipping to their repair facility in another state, and they would pay to ship it back to me. I sent out the broken headset in an envelope and waited several weeks with no correspondence from Panasonic. Nonetheless, I followed-up directly and was asked to provide proof of purchase (and to provide a purchase date). Again the line went cold for a couple weeks, until suddenly a box containing replacement headphones showed up at my doorstep. Now these actually didn't turn out to be the exact same model - my RP-HJE120s were now RP-HJE125s. But as far as I can tell, they are very similar and seem to work fine for now. In conclusion? Great durability on the first set and OK on the second.

But when you then see that they only cost about $7, your expectations probably go down quite a bit. Should they? Well, no. These Panasonic RP-HJE120's are among the best budget headphones you can get, though when compared to their slightly more expensive sibling, the RP-TCM125 's, their shortcomings are forced into the spotlight. In most aspects, they are very similar, but when it comes to sound, the 125's are far superior. The Good :) + Incredibly comfortable, courtesy of Panasonic's Ergo-Fit design + Surprisingly pleasant sound + Powerful bass + Good noise isolation + Lots of colors! + Small, low-profile design + Dirt cheap The Bad :( - Imbalanced, muddy sound - Lower-quality, tangle-prone cable - Lots of cable noise, wind noise, etc. The Quirky :/ ~ If worn improperly, they will sound horrible Still wondering why I recommend the 125's over the 120's? Read on to find out! -- Sound Quality -- Headphones are, first and foremost, a means of producing sound; thus, the quality of said sound is one of the most important aspects of a headphone. At this price point, expectations are already pretty low, so these will have no problem impressing listeners with powerful bass and immersive sound. At first listen, most people will think these sound fantastic, but when compared with a more precise pair, namely the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro over-ear studio headphones, the 120's shortcomings become increasingly noticeable. This pair, in addition to enhancing the bass, also scales back the treble, making for a skewed, unnatural, muddy sound signature. When I first tried these out, I thought they were fantastic, because the best headphones I had ever heard were my SOL Republic Tracks , which have a very similarly skewed signature. Treble instruments and vocals sound reasonably realistic, but are overpowered by the massive bass response from these headphones. If you love powerful bass from the likes of SOL Republic and Beats, these may be a good choice. But for everyone else, your money is better spent on the RP-TCM125's, which still offer impactful bass response that is more prominent than an unexciting studio pair, but also have clear, crisp treble response, making for a mostly balanced and definitely enjoyable sound signature. Plus, they come with a 1-button remote and mic and are still very cheap at just over $10 on Amazon (at the writing of this review). -- It's worth noting that the rest of the review also applies to the RP-TCM125's, so if you've already read my review of that pair, you'll miss nothing by skipping to the conclusion. -- Comfort and Design -- Moving on to the fit, one of the major strengths of this pair, these sport Panasonic's Ergo-Fit design, which is just a fancy way of saying that the in-ear part, instead of being circular (as most in-ear headphones are), is elliptical. It's one of those \"well, duh\" innovations; it's a super simple change but it makes a world of difference. Since humans' outer ear canal is taller than it is wide, an elliptical design makes it fit a lot better than a circular design without the need to get a custom-molded earpiece. Until I tried these headphones, all in-ears I had tried required excessive force to put in, were uncomfortable while they were in, and were constantly trying to escape my ears. By contrast, Ergo-Fit headphones are easy to put in, are incredibly comfortable while they're in, and are generally quite good at staying in their place. It's worth mentioning here that the \"In-Ear\" in the product name is important; if these are not literally *in* your ears, they'll sound horrendous. The sound is designed to be the way it is when it has the benefit of a seal so it only has to fill the tiny cavity in your ear with sound. Without that seal, you'll still be able to hear stuff, but it will be tinny and completely devoid of any bass or low-mid response. If it doesn't feel like you're wearing earplugs, you're doing it wrong. By virtue of the in-ear design, they block out a good deal of outside noise and keep your tunes in your own ears. Sound leakage into the outside world is minimal; don't expect anyone to hear your tunes unless you listen at incredibly loud, unsafe levels. It's also nice that they come in a variety of colors, and all the colors I've owned or otherwise seen in person (orange, red, purple, blue, green, black, and white) look good. They're also incredibly convenient by virtue of their small size and incredibly low price! Keep in mind, however, internal sounds (chewing, etc.) are amplified dramatically. So, if you want something you can listen to while eating, you should probably get a pair of on-ear or over-ear headphones. And if you use them for running, it may be worth it to invest in a higher-end pair that is designed with a more secure fit. -- Build -- Of course, \"dirt cheap\" usually means they cut back in some area. Well, if anything, the build would be mildly disappointing. The cable isn't very robust and, at times, can be very prone to tangling. Thankfully, major tangles are few and far between. Some other areas of weakness are cable noise and wind noise, but these have more to do with in-ear headphones in general than these ones specifically. -- Conclusion -- I still stand by my initial impression that they are worth a lot more than their price tag suggests. But when it comes to sound, bassheads are likely to thoroughly enjoy these, while everybody else will be better served with the 125's.

I am super impressed with these earbuds. If you told me that I could have a pair of earbuds that sounded great, did not distort any sound, were comfortable, looked decent, and they were only 8 dollars, I WOULD SLAP YOU AND CALL YOU A LIAR!! I would be severely mistaken however (and arrested), as I am dead wrong. I had read reviews on a couple of different websites that these were the El Dorado of earbuds under 50 dollars. Some were so brave as to exclaim that these were the best earbuds under 100 dollars. I then found 33,000 reviews on Amazon with the overwhelming majority saying that these are THE best cheap earbud to get. These brash claims caught my attention, and as a gadget guru and headphone enthusiast, I had no choice but to succumb to the lavish price of 8 dollars. For those interested in a breakdown: these come with three sets of eartips, which I had to play with because I could not find the right size at first. Making sure you have the right size ear tips in is CRUCIAL, because it will form a seal around your ear and you will be able to isolate and block external noise better, hear the music louder and clearer, and the bass will be more prominent. I have had these for a week so far and have used them for a multitude of things. I\u2019ve watched movies, listened to music while mowing the lawn (these were sufficient at for drowning out most noise), worked out with them, and used them for playing games. The best things I would recommend them for are for just casually listening to music and watching movies. This is my general test on how good headphones are: Play Rage Against the Machine and see if I can get pumped up on the bass, then play I Saw Her Standing There by The Beatles and see if I can hear George Harrison twanging away on his guitar over Paul McCartney\u2019s overpowering bass. These definitely beat a lot of over the ear headphones that I own. The sound is balanced and I could hear everything almost exactly like the original audio recording.  They also had a reasonable audio level and got as loud as I needed them before I hit the highest setting. I would not recommend these for working out, as they just kept falling out of my ears and distracting me while I was running.I also would say that these are not an acceptable headphone for FPS or multiplayer gaming, as you really need an over the ear set to amp up all the noise in the game and help give you directional listening. I could not pinpoint footsteps / etc. with these earbuds as well as with my Audio Technica and Polk Headsets. Also, you need a decent mic for voice chat and this model does not have a mic. Generally though, these are worth it for everything else mentioned. So, here I am. Telling you to get these. Get them now. Don\u2019t hesitate. **TL/DR: 8 Dollar headphones, why you not buy?** **PRODUCT UPDATE 08/14/16** 5 stars dropped to 3 What am I doing up at 1247am on a Sunday? One may answer that I am at a club having a great time, or watching a movie with my fiance, or having a sleepover with my family, but the answer to that question is none of the above. I am awake at this hour as your sworn headphone avenger, to tell you not to buy these headphones. You should buy these headphones instead: JVC HAFX5B Gumy Plus Inner Ear Headphones -Black Why? Because I was a bit over zealous on my initial review. At the time of writing the original review, I had not found a suitable alternative for a cheap and reasonably decent sounding pair of headphones. But - just like all politicians, at some point when you make a public statement you have to back track when you're mouth was moving faster than your brain. I bought the JVC Gumy headphones from Best Buy a few weeks ago and I was intending to test them side by side with the Panasonic Ergofits. I noticed some immediate improvements that the JVCs had over the Panasonics. One was that the gummy seals for your ear are a lot more comfortable. secure, and provide a much better seal than the Panasonics did. The next improvement was the mic and control button(which the upgraded ergofit has, but you shouldn't go without it). The most important feature that the JVCs have over the Panasonic is its performance. When I listened to One More Time by Daft Punk on both headphones, the Panasonics were very level all around and there was nothing spectacular that stood out. When I used the JVCs, my ears exploded with delight from the much better bass response it had. I have been using the JVCs for everything since then and I haven't looked back.", "date": "13 Jul 2016", "images": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TYZ3zacRL._SY88.jpg\nhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R8OeqjXkL._SY88.jpg", "author": "Knights Of Ren Disciple", "rating": "3.0", "found_helpful": "164 people found this helpful", "variant": "Color: Black Style: No Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar"}, {"title": "Not very well made, but work in a pinch.", "content": "Bought these for my wife to use while on her tablet.

Honestly I thought the Skullcandy sounded significantly better, and were louder too.  Those totally and instantly impressed me when I first got them, comparing them to the ones which came with my Sony NWZS545BLK .  I used these stock Sony plugs in the interim while these Panasonics were shipping, and while the Panas sound better, it is not the significant better sound the skull candys impressed upon me. These don't sound bad, but they do not have the low thumping bass or the crisp trebles of the Skull Candys.  It is like a multiuband eq with all the mid ranges up and all the highs and lows attenuated. They were delivered 2 days after I broke the Skullcandy's.  They sound like there is a thin attenuating barrier between them and my ear, and certain guitar riffs or female voices to not get that penetration that tickles the inside of my skull and could force this mysterious water like substance from my eyes that my former buds could. My Music ranges from Mozart to Operation Ivy to Parov Stelar, and these buds just  can't make me tear up, mosh, or shake it like an 'x'ing person on a dancefloor.  The SC's could.  The lack of volume is probably good for my long term hearing, but sometimes I need that almost painful level to coax the emotion, and these do not have that little extra Oomph. I always preferred the 'no equalizer' with the SC's with most music, but this setting just sounds incredibly dull with these headphones, but none of the preset eq settings can tickle the inside of my skull, nor do they seem to react the same way to changes as did as with the SC's, nor can I tune in the thumping bass or crisp trebles I was used to on the manual 5 band EQ. Not obvious in the photo of these Panasonics is that the rubber buds are offset to the body of the plug and are labeled L and R.  I think this design is superior and certainly fits nicer in my ear than the skull candy's which could be inserted into either ear.  I never thought the SC's fit poorly, I just noticed these fit better and tugs on the cord will not draw them from my ear as easily. I think the Skull Candy's reduced ambient noise to a greater degree as well, and this might have saved the life of My landlord's  skreeching parakeet, may it die a slow painful annoying death soon.  Freaking useless animal which fills me with rage.  I daydream of killing it with a sledge hammer. The wires themselves are thinner than the SC's and do not have the sliding constrictor to hold the 2 individual leads closer together around my neck, or tight together for wrapping them up for storage, a feature which i liked a lot on the SC's.  These thinner wires to not transfer as much rubbing noises to the headphones as the SC's however.  The 3.5mm jack has a 90 degree bend on it.  Not sure how I feel about that.  I think it will stress the plug in the MP3 player itself more, and that is how my last 3 units failed internally. For under 7$ I'm not complaining, much, but the reviews had me expecting  a slightly improved sound over my previous headphones, and I'm not finding that true in any degree, and I will be looking for an improvement over both in my next pair in the 20 to 35$ range.

Sure they're very inexpensive, but they're also really cheap. I suppose at this price point, the majority of the 5 star reviewers are unlikely to be used to the sound and quality of much better products. I guess I should admit I've used a variety of much more expensive ones including Etymotic, Shure and Ultimate Ears. But I still think there is some sort of weird group-think dynamic happening here. So I offer up my much more critical review. I guess some are impressed by lots of bass, but the bass from these is honestly muddy and there's too just much of it. There's no tightness or clarity in the low end- it's like the 80hz bass knob is cranked to the max. As for the rest of the frequency range, they are fully acceptable, and I'd go so far as to say they're good, especially for the $. But overall, aside from one or two sets of ear buds I've tried which were totally unacceptable, these pale in comparison just about everything else I've used. My old favorite budget buds are an old pair of discontinued Sony MDR EX70's I believe those were in the mid $30 range a few years back. The Sony's have strong bass, but it is clean. They've lasted me over 10 years. I recently picked up a pair of MEElectronics M6-CL-MEE (as I write this $16.99, I believe I paid closer to $12.99) which blow these out of the water in nearly every way- much cleaner and much more balanced top to bottom. They also offer much better construction, come with a zippered carrying case with a compartment for the extra ear buds, have a clothing clip and a sliding binder to keep them tangle free, and tight on the back of your head (they wrap over the ear to keep them in place, IEM / sport style). The cord on the MEE's is much better quality and more tangle resistant. The cord on these Panasonic's is about as cheap as I've seen- it reminds me of the disposable ones you get on airplanes. These do fit fairly well and are easier to insert than the MEE's, but the hard plastic angled body is a bit uncomfortable against my ears. The smaller Sony buds are so soft and comfortable that I can sleep on my side with them in and barely feel them. It'd be silly compare these to any of the $100 plus models I have, except to say that none of them is perfect either (two are a little light on bass, one is fantastic sounding but I can't wear them for more than an hour). Some have said these are the best of the super cheap buds, and I can accept that. If you tear up or lose your buds frequently, these might be the ticket. But if you are looking for good sound, quality, and can spend a little more, you'd probably be better off. Given the moderately decent sound at such a cheap price point,  I'd probably give them one more star if they had a better cord that didn't tangle so easily, the packaging (welded blister-pack which was quite difficult to cut open) didn't suck so bad. Also changing rubber tips stinks on these- much harder than any other bud I've used.", "date": "19 May 2013", "images": null, "author": "JdoubleH", "rating": "3.0", "found_helpful": null, "variant": "Color: Black Style: No Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ergofit-Headphones-Metallic-RP-HJE120-RA/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}, {"title": "Good for the price", "content": "They work ok but I wear them out - go through 2-3 pair a year.", "date": "02 Jan 2023", "images": null, "author": "J smith", "rating": "3.0", "found_helpful": "One person found this helpful", "variant": "Color: Metallic Blue Style: No Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ergofit-Headphones-Metallic-RP-HJE120-RA/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}, {"title": "The Best of Both Worlds", "content": "The Best of Both Worlds For comparison purposes, I bought these earbuds along with the Panasonic RPHJE355K buds. I figured whichever pair was the better set would be my everyday set and the other set would be my spare set or I could give them to one of my sons. I didn't like either pair but I found a solution that has me satisfied. I tried the RPHJE120K's first. These are not 5 star earbuds, and not quite 4 stars but they are definitely a good value. They probably are better than whatever stock earbuds came with your device. I could see myself using these everyday and being satisfied, however when I tried the 355's I knew I could not live with the 120's as my everyday set. My primary test song was \"December\" by Collective Soul. It has a wide dynamic range, good mix of instruments and several instances of bass drum punch and cymbals with which to put the earbuds through their high and low frequency paces. I also fiddled with the equalizer settings on my mobile device. (Google music player on Moto Razr Maxx HD.) FYI, for most music listening I leave the equalizer off but used it to test these earbuds. Using the medium sized earpiece these buds have decent bass and adequate treble. As others have reported, using the large size earpiece the bass really comes out (and I like good bass in an earbud.) However, while they had good amounts of bass, especially with the large ear tips, I would characterize the bass as being slightly muddy. I would also say that the high end notes are not fully realized and lack the clarity of the 355's. Overall I would say these earbuds are decent but lack crispness and clarity. The 355's were almost the opposite. They had very crisp and clear notes but inadequate bass. I would characterize these buds as being bright in sound color and lacking in bass. I'm tempted to use the word \"tinny\" but the high notes were full and reproduced well, if a bit overemphasized. Using the large sized earpieces improved the bass but only marginally. I'm happy to report the bass was clear, not muddy like the 120's, but there wasn't enough of it. Still not satisfied with either set. Then came the eureka moment--why not put the large ear tips from the 120's onto the 355's? I did that and found my everyday set of earbuds! Good, clear bass and bright, crisp (but not overly emphasized) high notes. The best of both worlds. So why not buy the 355's and a set of replacement earbud tips in size large?

Slow down.", "content": "If you have found your way here the same way I did, through the Wirecutter review of earphones under $30 claiming that these headphones are the best sounding headphones in the price range, then please, control your expectations. I am an avid fan of a wide range of podcasts and I practically collect inexpensive earbuds because, not only do I wear them a lot, I damage and lose them a lot. I have more expensive, better headphones, but for day-to-day use a pair of headphones like these Panasonics are right in the price range of what I use for most of my listening. I read the Wirecutter's review of these and bought a pair to see what I have been missing. The answer; nothing. They are a generally acceptable pair of cheap earbuds with a microphone. I compared them to a couple of other similarly inexpensive earbuds and found that they are not only not better, in some regards they were worse. As someone who rarely (never) reviews products on Amazon, I felt it was necessary to try to bring some perspective to the discussion. These headphones are fine. For the price, they are a good choice. Wirecutter's review made them sound like they are far more than they are regarding their sound \"The Panasonic won because they sounded the best. Hands down. They were everyone\u2019s top choice in terms of sound fidelity. They have a nice overall balance with airy, mellow highs and present-but-not-dominating bass. They sound just as good listening to acoustic guitar as they do hip hop and rock. Nothing pierces, nothing muddies: every frequency plays well with the others. And as you\u2019ll see with other contenders later, that\u2019s not often the case in this price range.\" When considered alongside their lackluster build quality (from the Wirecutter \"their plasticky design won\u2019t be winning any awards for beauty or construction\") I can say that I will not be purchasing another pair of these. I have been through lots of other sub-$30... actually, sub-$20 as is my rule for day-to-day wear headphones... that sound as good, if not better, and have a better build quality.", "date": "07 Jan 2014", "images": null, "author": "Daniel B.

These don't do that.  I also tend to go to sleep with them in my ears, to block out noise on my block, and unlike others i've owned these are often still seated when i wake up. they work very well blocking external noise. CONS: the biggest disappointment in these buds is the size of the plug.  since it's not pictured i forgot to check.  the plug is large and blocky, and i had to remove the case on my iphone 5c to plug the buds in.  so unless your case has a HUGE opening over the earphone jack, consider that you will either have to modify it if you can, or remove it to use these earbuds. another small point to consider, which is not really a con, is that these earbuds are designed with a flat area of plastic outside the buds that extends over part of the immediately surrounding earlobe.  this element of the design is helpful in getting the right and left sides correct, since the buds have to match right or left ears to fit.  but, if you are in a hurry to get them seated as i sometimes am, or if you are fumbling with them in the dark as i often am, it can be a little frustrating.  the benefit is, for multimedia especially, it can be more enjoyable to have the orientation correct.  when i'm watching a movie and something is moving across the screen while creating sound, it's nice to get the \"surround sound\" effect accurately.  for music i'm not sure it really matters.", "date": "25 Sep 2014", "images": null, "author": "Ophelia", "rating": "3.0", "found_helpful": null, "variant": "Color: Silver Style: No Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ergofit-Headphones-Metallic-RP-HJE120-RA/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}, {"title": "Counterfeits?", "content": "I've noticed some other reviewers writing warnings about counterfeit products, due to them receiving products with varying levels of quality. I too have experienced this. I ordered my first two pairs of earbuds in November 2018 and April 2019, both from the Amazon.com Services Inc. vendor, and they were of excellent quality. I then ordered another pair in August from a third party vendor (a very highly rated vendor, mind you). But the quality of this third pair was far lower than the first two. I brought this to the attention of Amazon and was given a replacement pair. The replacement pair (from same vendor) was also very low quality.  Contacting Amazon again, they offered me a full refund and told me to just keep the earbuds. About a month later in September, I decided to try one more time (I really love these earbuds). Having realized that the \"counterfeit\" earbuds came from a third-party vendor, I decided to order again from Amazon.com Services Inc. This was the vendor that I originally ordered from. This time, the pair I received were excellent quality. Now, I'm not completely certain that the lower quality pair were counterfeits. It could easily be that Panasonic contracts many different manufacturing plants to make these earbuds. Some of these plants might have different quality control standards, and this third party vendor (which was very highly rated) might've gotten a bad batch. I did notice a slight difference on the packaging between the earbuds. On the back of the packaging, all the way down at the bottom, there is a four character code. The code for the good pair is 8I1H. The code for the bad pair is 8G3H. My guess is that these codes are either identifying the batch number, or the plant that they came from. That is all the information that I have. I hope this can help others figure out what is going on. My advice to anyone considering buying these earbuds is to buy two or three pairs from two or three different vendors, compare the different qualities (It will be obvious which pairs are \"real\" and which ones are \"counterfeits\"), and return the lower quality pair(s).

Unfortunately, they left me disappointed. They might be a good fit for someone else, just not for me. Here's why.... Pros: 1. OK for watching videos online or on YouTube, or other non-musical activities. Clear sound, no static, and no unwanted echoing. 2. They do a good job of blocking out external noise when listening to music, and when no music is playing while wearing them they still block out about at least half of the background noise. 3. Probably ok for someone who listens to their music at a generally quieter level than most, those who do not mind losing much of a song's typical bass quality, and/or those with sensitive ears that require lower or less-intense audio and/or volume levels. Parents who would love their kids to have a good pair of volume-limiting headphones may appreciate these greatly. (See # 1 on my list of \"Cons\" below for why I am saying so....) 4. The fit is a little different than some other ear buds on the market. This can be a pro or con depending on the person using them, but for me, they were comfortable to wear for decent periods of time without any ear discomfort. (Comfortably physically, not musically.) I wore them for about 2-3 hours at a time during a few online webinars. Cons: 1. Loss of music quality and volume. Seriously... I would use the headphones that came with my iPod instead of ever using these if it came down to that. I say this because I found the volume maximum to be about the same, if not quieter, than even some of those intentionally lowered-volume headphones on the market today (the kind of headphones I'm referring to are the buds/headphones that set the maximum volume lower than the standard buds/headphones on the market in an attempt to proactively keep kids from going deaf when they decide to blast the volume on their iPods and mp3s). The only problem with that being, for someone like me who has great hearing and a love of music, the songs sound like they are at a partial volume despite both my iPod and laptop being at their respective maximum volume levels. I typically will never turn any of my devices up that high, but after receiving these and giving them a test-run, I was trying to see if raising the volume level on my devices would resolve the lack of satisfaction, excessive lack of bass, and the lack of volume in the music coming through these headphones. This leads me to the next con... 2. The fit. Thinking that maybe I was using the wrong attachment size for my ears and that perhaps it was affecting the quality of the music or muffling the music somehow, I tried every single size of the attachments that had been provided. Despite the sizing not affecting the quality or volume level at all, I also found that it was difficult to figure out which way these are supposed to sit in the ear. I positioned them in the way my other in-ear headphones would sit, yet these still seemed to be 'off.' Perhaps it is because of the uniquely angled design? After playing with it for a bit, I found a comfortable position that allowed the noise-cancelling to work its magic; however the volume levels, while still on the quieter side and seemed to vary depending on the song that was playing. This caused me to keep readjusting them, almost as if they had somehow moved out of place or something. I have not had this problem with any other in-ear headphones I've purchased before. I would have concluded that these headphones not being positioned correctly was the cause for the volume/sound quality issues I was experiencing when using these, however after a couple hours of trying every position and depth humanly possible with these, I figure it's mainly the output I'm having an issue with, rather than their fit. Conclusion: I will probably keep these stashed away as back-up in case I lose whatever pair I am currently using to listen to my music with, or perhaps only use them for webinars and the like, but these just weren't a good fit for me. For the price, maybe these aren't so bad (especially if these are the qualities you are looking for in a pair of headphones), but I have never spent more than $15 on headphones or ear buds in my life and these didn't compare very well to the many others I have tried. I even thought for a moment that maybe I'd just lost some hearing or gone a little deaf over time when I realized how limited these headphones sounded to me, but my friend let me borrow her JVC gumy headphones to test my ears and the audio/volume from her headphones turned out to be fine, even at my device's lower volume levels. The JVC gumy ear buds she lent me were just like the gumys I used to buy regularly every six months or so prior to purchasing these Panasonic headphones. The JVC gumys sound amazing and don't really sacrifice any bass in spite of their ridiculously affordable price, but after the prop 65 warning that they are required to share with consumers had been posted, I chose to move on to healthier audio pastures. I had truly hoped these Panasonic headphones would be just that - but they aren't.

I've lost them and replaced them several times over the years and was always happy with them.  However, lately I've been listening with a pair of AKG earbuds I found laying around.  They are the same price as these Panasonics, however their treble is way brighter and their bass actually exists noticeably.  More importantly, the AKG earbuds sound more crystal clear compared to these, which sound dull and blurbled by comparison.  I compared the two side by side from a few of my favorite spotify songs and a couple of scenes from recently streamed shows/movies (dialogue scenes, action scenes with explosions, etc), and found the AKG noticeable better in every scenario.  The tangleless braided cable on the AKG is superior to these panasonics as well.  I don't know what happened to Panasonic, but they are just not as good as I remember... very disappointed with it.

Would recommend just cutting the wire and using the earbuds as effective ear plugs to block out the noise when sleeping or working in a noisy environment.  I also just noticed It seems they also added a sharp surface on the outside edge of the earbud that pushes against your outer ear, and will leave an imprint on your outer ear if you're laying down with them, so maybe don't use them for sleeping after all. They somehow managed to ruin an already great ergonomic design by adding this sharp edge to the outside brim.

I have relatively small ears and I am hypersensitive to physical discomforts that other people aren't very bothered by (or don't feel uncomfortable with at all).

I wasn\u2019t expecting great sound, but these managed to disappoint even my modest expectations.  First thing I noticed is that you have to turn the volume higher than you normally would just to get the same level of sound.  Second observation: the lack of any bass.  I don\u2019t even like anything that is base heavy.  I like balance in my music and earphones.  These lack even the basic amount of bass which may be related to my third observation; how hollow the music sounds.  For lack of better terminology/wording, the sound lacks depth.  It\u2019s as if these can only play sound w/in a certain frequency range and that range is pretty small.  I guess you get what you pay for. Headphones that I\u2019ve owned/used: iPhone 4 and 5 headphones, Klipsch S4, basic Sony over the hear headphones, and Audio-Technica noise canceling ones.  Excluding the iPhone 4 ones which I can\u2019t remember how those sounded, these Panasonic units are by far the worst set of headphones I have ever owned.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Notice a pattern?  If these are suppose to be the best cheap headphones that is available on the market right now then I will definitely have to spend more to get some decent ones.  Oh Klipsch S4, why did you have to break on me?!  I thought could get a decent set of headphones for a cheap price.  I was wrong, very very wrong. Note: to anyone who thinks I\u2019m not using these incorrectly; if I stuff these any further inside my ear, I\u2019ll need a doctor to get these out.", "date": "12 Mar 2014", "images": null, "author": "Private Information", "rating": "2.0", "found_helpful": null, "variant": "Color: Silver Style: No Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar"}, {"title": "Broken after five months.

Can't believe thousands of people have given these good reviews!!", "content": "I read review after review of these earbuds, just to be sure I was getting something as good as the ones I've had for 2 years that were great, though did not fit so well. The ones that did not fit well had bigger speakers, plain and simple, and though they were in-ear buds, were just slightly too large for me, but they SOUNDED GREAT!  However, after reading reviews of these Panasonics, (RPTCM125V) I bought them, and they are HORRIBLE earbuds. I read several reviews that said they had to be well seated in the ear. I tried, tried again, and again, swiveled them this way and that, and they simply don't provide enough range to their sound unless I hold pressure on them while listening, and even then, not as much depth as my previous pair. That is not a reasonable expectation. So what I get from my old ones, which are about 12mm diameter and ROUND, is FULL range of sounds, very nice base, very nice mids, excellent highs, and little external noise - just enough to hear a horn or someone yelling. With these Panasonics I can hear everything that happens around me, and can barely hear my music, and there is ZERO bass to these - listening to Milt Hinton (Jazz bassist) and I can't hear... literally can't hear his base. Put my old ones in, sounds great. I have more than one pair of these Panasonics, both the same, so it's not just a bum pair. So yes, some people said you have to really get these to fit right, but if you don't, these are terrible. I never could. Tried all three rubber nibs that came with them. none would fit correctly. Very disappointing, except that I paid $7.00 ish for them, so don't mind keeping them as emergency buds. Bummer my old ones have now lost one side. Now, I'm a particular person, and I am somewhat of an electronics person, audiophile etc. So, while I don't re-hash all the specs on things, the claims of others that they sound great are likely because they've never had a truly good pair. I had to go up three notches on my iPhone volume to hear well with the Panasonics. That one factor alone tells me that these are just too little speaker for decent sound. If I can't get enough volume, then there is not enough speaker. There it is.. my 2 star review. 2 stars because they're cheap and do work. Don't buy'em if you are REALLY looking for good sound. If you generally don't care, buy two. They're cheap.

Hell, these earbuds used to last better than expensive ones, I once bought $20 earbuds to replace a pair of these that broke and that pair only lasted a month before one of the wire snapped, and when I replaced it with one of these again I had no issues. But this past year I've had 2 of these break on me within a few months. The first pair lasted only 2 months and then one of the earbuds literally broke apart, the piece connecting the earbud (the part you put in your ear) broke off, revealing the wire inside and unable to be fixed. I thought okay, maybe I got unlucky and got a dud, so I ordered another one and it worked well, but a month of use and the same exact thing happened, one of the earbuds broke apart, and I did absolutely nothing to it.

The problem is that in order to get that deep, rich audio - particularly bass response - these have to be really well-embedded in your ear, and these are so painful to wear that it's borderline intolerable.  And that's surprising, because Panasonic is a company I generally trust to produce great stuff. These are all hard edges and unyielding, bone-crunching solidity where there should be soft-as-a-pillow comfort, and a veritable 3D geometry puzzle of angles and tangents and things evocative of the proverbial dog's hind leg where a simple straight line would be fine. They're hard to get far enough into your ear because of that big disc-shaped thing in the middle of the horizontal axis; they hurt like hell all the way in because the pads that are supposed to provide cushion between the plastic and your living tissue are both small and thin; and they're hard to keep in your ear once they're there (assuming you've chosen to grit your teeth and take the pain for the sake of music,) because the business end that houses the actual speaker is too small in diameter and too short in extent to get any useful friction - particularly when that big disc thing is snugged up against your dorsal metamoglopsolesis or whatever it's called, which is pushing it in the opposite direction, namely: out. Lest you assume I have abnormal ears, I've used dozens of different earbuds and earphones and roughly half of them feel better in your ear than nothing at all.

I like them so much that I went to the Roku site and bought a three-pack of them. [And no, I'm in no way affiliated with Roku and nobody is paying me to say this.

If I try to push them in slightly, to make them snugger, then the sound becomes very low level and muddy;  probably pushing in the buds obstructs the small hole where the sound comes out.

At any rate, I find the balance very unpleasant for music listening.  They might be OK for audio books, but I wanted them for music. They have no \"noise cancellation\" because that feature require active circuitry and small microphones on each earpiece.  (In fact I can't think of any earbuds that have noise cancellation, although everybody has heard of the Bose noise cancelling *headphones* which are pretty good. If Amazon really wanted to ask about \"noise isolation\" ... ability of the device to keep external noise from sneaking into the ear canal ... then these earbuds could have that feature.  They could ... but they don't.  Isolation is almost nonexistent. The Amazon review form asks about \"moisture wicking.\"  How could earbuds have that feature?  Headphones might have a headband with a moisture wicking pad; headphones might have moisture wicking ear pads.  But this product is not a headphone ... it's an earbud.  As such, \"moisture wicking\" doesn't apply AFAIK. In conclusion, these are very disappointing.  Sonically they are think and basically awful for music.  If you want something that sounds a whole lot better, try a pair of Tascam HD-02 *headphones*.  Sure, they're not earbuds, and they're not the world's best headphones.

I got these because my previous earbuds, a pair of JVC HAFX1X Headphone Xtreme-Xplosivs which were great while they lasted, started losing sound in the left side.  I searched for earbuds by average reviews, and was AMAZED to see one pair of inexpensive earbuds with nearly 12 thousand reviews, a 4 1/2 star average rating, most of them raving about how wonderful they are, especially for such a great price!  So I bought them. When I first tried them out, I switched to the large buds, as I do with most earbuds, which I could feel fit my ears quite nicely.  I point this out to assure any possible readers that my problem can't be blamed on wearing them incorrectly or not fitting them in right.  I listened to some music on them and instantly noticed how inferior they sounded compared to any other inexpensive earbuds I've owned. These earbuds are so QUIET, and lifeless.  Like many of the other low reviews state, there's hardly any bass, or sound in general for that matter.  With all the earbuds and earphones I've used, I've always been able to listen to my music around the same volume levels without too much disparity.  I usually have my volume, on a meter from muted-100, around 25-30.  With these earbuds, in order to hear my music as loudly as I normally do around 25-30, I had to turn my volume up to 90.  And even at a louder volume, there still wasn't any punch to it.  Just flat. I know, for $10, how can I really complain too much.  But this review isn't about the money.  It's about the confusion in why these earbuds have not only so many good reviews, but so many reviews in general.  12 thousand reviews?  Are you kidding?

This my third failure, this last one having been comped to me by Panasonic after the failure of its predecessor, and three strikes you're out. Years ago I bought a straight-up no frills version of these Ergos - no mic, no pause - and today that's what I'm using, until I  decide on a replacement.

I was specifically looking for headphones with a straight, thin plug so they would fit in my phone case. I tried it anyway, and it does not fit. It is false advertising to have a photo in the listing that does not portray the product accurately. I would not have bought these if I knew they didn't have a straight plug. 2) They are cheap. I knew that before I bought them. But they make a clicking sound every time a sound starts or stops. It's fine while listening to music constantly, but I also use them for games and other apps which only make a noise every few seconds, so it's constantly clicking. Maybe that's tolerable for you, but know that you get what you pay for. 3) This is very minor, but just an fyi. The green color is a little strange. The color of the actual earbuds is close to what's pictured, but the cord is more of a light pea or spring green. There are some positives: 1) The sound quality really is very good, especially for the price. You just need to make sure they're fitting in your ears properly, with a tight seal. They block out a great amount of background noise too, if worn properly. 2) They are pretty comfortable. I only wore them for a couple hours, just sitting on the couch, but they never felt loose or fell out. My ears were a tiny bit sore, but probably just because I've previously been using the same pair for many years, and these are shaped differently.

They are even more comfortable than the Apple ones I have replaced a couple of times at $30 each time.  I was concerned that they would plug up my ears to make the pressure painful - I have had some of those over the years - but these do not.  I can also hear what is going on around me when I wear these, which is a plus if I am out walking and listening to music.  Sound is great, fit is perfect, both of which are the most important to me, as they probably are to all who buy earbuds.  Highly recommended. Only con: if I watch a movie or listen to music in bed and fall asleep with these in my ears, they are not comfortable to sleep with; they feel lumpy and bothersome when I sleep on my side.  Thus, I use my old Apple ones (which are down to only one plug since the other one stopped working) if I want to listen to a movie or music in bed since the Apple ones are \"flatter\" against my ears.", "date": "30 Oct 2016", "images": null, "author": "EM", "rating": "2.0", "found_helpful": "6 people found this helpful", "variant": "Color: Black Style: With Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ergofit-Headphones-Metallic-RP-HJE120-RA/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}, {"title": "If you get a defective pair, don't expect any customer service help and say goodbye to your money", "content": "I purchased a pair of these earphones in December 2017 due to the overwhelming number of positive reviews. When they first arrived I was so happy with the sound quality, comfort level in-ear, and their ability to block outside noise. I use my headphones for schoolwork or to watch movies on my computer; I am by no means rough with them, I store them carefully, I'd had my last pair for 8 years, etc. However, only one month after purchase, the left earphone suddenly shorted out and ceased working. I attempted to return them through Amazon and was instead told to contact Panasonic directly. I tried numerous times to use the Panasonic website's live chat support feature but kept getting a message that there were no employees on live chat at this time (no matter what time of day I tried). I then called their 1-888 support number and the first thing the automated message warned me was that I risked being charged a $9.99 service fee for help if I continued with the phone call and if my product turned out not to be covered under warranty. Given that I didn't know if the earphones were still covered under any limited warranty, I opted to just hang up at that point, write off my money spent, and order a second pair. They arrived on January 25, 2018, and again, I was satisfied. Less than two weeks later, while watching a homework video, the right earphone suddenly shorted out and stopped working. I called Panasonic again figuring that this time it had to be covered under some warranty at less than 2 weeks old. The customer service rep sent me the e-mail instructions to submit my proof of purchase for both pairs and I later received an e-mail back with the instructions for shipping the headphones. They stated that I was only allowed to ship the product in one specific type of corrugated cardboard container, that it needed to be  certain size of that container, and that I would need to pay for tracking and insurance on the product on top of the shipping. The total amount for shipping cost more than THREE pairs of these headphones and they wouldn't guarantee that they would send me two new pairs to replace the two broken ones. This is the worst experience I've ever had with a purchase from Amazon. I was disappointed and frustrated that I could not conduct my return directly through Amazon and have a replacement sent to me or my money refunded like is usually the case on Amazon, but instead had to do the whole runaround with Panasonic, and I still don't know whether Panasonic will honor its warranty and send me two new pairs. Based on the number of positive reviews for these earphones it seems like I did just get unlucky (twice) with defective pairs, however, if you're one of those unlucky ones you can count your money spent as lost based on the incredible hassle and lack of good customer service to make it right.", "date": "07 Feb 2018", "images": null, "author": "Phil", "rating": "1.0", "found_helpful": "1,521 people found this helpful", "variant": "Color: Black Style: No Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar"}, {"title": "Worst earbuds I've ever owned", "content": "Don't buy these!

The 9mm drivers, 20hz-20Khz range and 97dB/mW specs for these ErgoFits are pretty standard for good sounding buds so I assume the problem must be with Panasonic designing the speaker outlets on these as OVALS instead of round in the interest of more ergos and comfort.. Well, they should've left it alone because they're not any more comfortable and tbh, are closer to screetchy nails on a chalkboard than anything with \"hi-fidelity\" :-/ By the way, it has NOTHING to do with which size adapter is installed for \"making a better seal\", etc. See, since these Panasonic ErgoFits and some other buds called JVC Riptidz were both under six bucks, I got both and just tried them side-by-side. It was like night and day! To those that feel the bass on these is adequate, it may be because you don't have another set for an immediate relative comparison, or it's just a matter of taste where bass isn't a priority. I'm not surprised the Riptidz blew these out of the water because they've got bigger drivers, a wider freq range and higher output overall. JVC Riptidz:  11mm drivers, 10hz-20Khz range, 101dB/mW output. Panasonic ErgoFit:  9mm drivers, 20hz-20Khz range,  97dB/mW output. It's just a matter of physics and the numbers don't lie: the Riptidz deliver more quantity of low end, while the mids and highs were more similar. But even for songs (or parts of songs) where the low end wasn't prevalent, the ErgoFits seemed shrill, cold and lifeless in comparison while the Riptidz were better balanced tonally. I probably wouldn't have been so harsh on these Ergofits if I didn't have the Riptidz for a relative side-by-side comparison, so you may actually find these, \"OK\". To sum up, I'd advise steering clear of these and going with the JVC's or you may find yourself fiddling with ear adapters and your EQ in some futile hunt for all the missing BASS.

I watched half of a movie on my laptop, switched them to my MP3 and walked 3 miles, did a little stretching then put them on my dresser...the next morning I started my MP3 and the sound in the left ear kept going in and out, I checked to make sure the jack was plugged in all the way and as soon as I touched it the sound came back but when I let go it went out in the left ear again. I'm an adult, not hard on the things I have (I've had the same Sony MP3 player for 4 years and it's going strong) and I know better than to pull on the cord when removing the buds from my ears so obviously I'm not impressed with the durability will be asking Amazon for a refund. YAY! Finally a pair of earbuds that don't hurt my ears... Not sure why it is, maybe I have small ears, but I frequently have problems with earbuds hurting after wearing them for only a minute or two. I haven't had any problem with these hurting even when wearing the for long periods of time, in fact they are really comfortable, and so far they are staying put in my ears when I'm doing busy with more energetic activities (think biking, yoga, vacuuming, race walking, etc.). Sound is good (although I'm no audiophile), clear without any undesirable static noises and the bass sounds good to me. I can't speak for their ability to stand up to daily use as I haven't had them long, but if they fail I'll come back with an update.

I don't think the product reviews or description accurately reflect the product I received. My main issues are 1) the weight. So light weight (and kinky from the packaging) that they catch on everything, won't stay put, and don't offer resistance to the body to keep the buds in ear. 2) there is no fit bead to tighten the loose, light wires below the chin. This is my bad for not noticing that before I bought it. 3) sound quality is just awful. Worse than the broken headphones that I replaced with these. If you move slightly the sound switches between ears and will do both or only one. The constant shifting is so distracting. Entirely impractical unless you are using them in a still position. 4) I've bought headphones in tight packaging before and even though the cord was wrapped tightly, the wire insulation was thick enough to maintain the integrity of the wiring and quickly straighten out. I like to keep my headphone cords straight because wire memory can cause them to break faster if they aren't taken care of. I think the very thin and light wire insulation of these headphones combined with the packaging may have been the reason the sound delivery is off. Because I can't make a return, these will become my backup-backup headphones. I would rather use my old pair with one working bud as a back up before these. This was my experience with these headphones and the only remark I have to say is if you're like me and have to replace your 15 dollar headphones twice a year, just spend the money to buy a pair that is higher quality and will last because the 40 dollars I've spent this year on 3 sets of headphones could have been 1 pair that won't break so fast.

My spouse, who's an IT professional, said it seems like the act of plugging them in puts the music on pause. To get the music to play again, I had to refresh the page and reload my Amazon music.

My suspicion is the plug isn't built properly - any slight movement of the wire, my phone, etc. would cause the sound to be bad - only in one ear, volume would go down, remote wouldn't work, etc. Would go in an out, especially if I put my phone in my pocket and was walking, which I often do. I'm pretty sure the plug wasn't staying in the headphone jack properly - maybe it was too small? I thought maybe my phone case was doing something (i.e. too thick and was 'pulling' the cord out), but tried without the case and had the same issue. On another note, couldn't figure out how to use the remote on the wire to change the volume - maybe I was missing how to use it for that, but I'm usually pretty good with this stuff, so pretty sure there wasn't a way to change the volume with it - if this was the case, it is a bad design.

Hopeful that a new pair will be better, but not entirely convinced....if a new pair works better, I plan to update this review.", "date": "21 Jun 2017", "images": null, "author": "Lavanya Ramadoss", "rating": "1.0", "found_helpful": "8 people found this helpful", "variant": "Color: White Style: With Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ergofit-Headphones-Metallic-RP-HJE120-RA/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}, {"title": "Failed me for the first time after 3 buys", "content": "Other types of earphones fall right out of my ears, but I always buy this exact pair of earphones because I like how they fit in my ears and it rarely falls out. It'll withstand even me running outside or on the treadmill. I also buy this consistently because of the quality of the product - the only reason I have to buy new ones is because I lose the old ones. There was one pair, however, that started to fall apart, but that's because I'm a clumsy person and I've had that pair for more than 2 years. I've never had a complaint about the audio quality. However, I did have to buy one recently, and the left ear just stopped working out of nowhere. This was less than a week after having it and after not having done anything to damage it.  I've never had this issue before with this brand. I don't know if the color affects the quality (maybe different colors are made in different factory lines), but for what it's worth, the first one I bought was the green one, and the next two I bought were blue. I never had issues where I had to position the cord juust right with those three. But the one that suddenly stopped working was the purple one that I just bought. EDIT: It is now the third week I've had this pair of earphones and the right one completely stopped working as well. The phone registers that I have earphones plugged in (works with other earphones), but no sound is coming out of it. I submitted an email to the contact support team and am now awaiting a response.", "date": "01 Dec 2019", "images": null, "author": "Dot", "rating": "1.0", "found_helpful": "One person found this helpful", "variant": "Color: Violet Style: With Mic", "verified_purchase": true, "product": "Panasonic ErgoFit Wired Earbuds, in-Ear Headphones with Dynamic Crystal-Clear Sound and Ergonomic Custom-Fit Earpieces (S/M/L), 3.5mm Jack for Phones and Laptops, No Mic - RP-HJE120-RA (Metallic Red)", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ergofit-Headphones-Metallic-RP-HJE120-RA/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}], "next_page": "https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ergofit-Headphones-Metallic-RP-HJE120-RA/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews", "average_rating": 4.3, "number_of_reviews": 66631, "histogram": {"5 star": "65%", "4 star": "17%", "3 star": "9%", "2 star": "4%", "1 star": "5%"}, "five_star_link": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar", "four_star_link": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar", "three_star_link": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar", "two_star_link": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar", "one_star_link": "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07J4RNY2S/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar"}
